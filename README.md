# What I want out of this course

What I hope for out of this course is that I come out of it a significantly stronger developer, mostly when it comes to my ability to solve leetcodes and other general interview style questions. I feel like that is one of the bigger gaps missing in my pool of knowledge, and I think it could make a big difference
